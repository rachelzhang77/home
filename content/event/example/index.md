summary: Assessing the impacts of gentrification on crime changes in Buffalo.
abstract: 'The growth of gentrification since the 1990s has significantly changed neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Some researchers argued that there is a positive relationship between gentrification and crime, while there are other scholars arguing for the negative association between them. However, much of this research fails to consider gentrification as a process rather than a discrete event. Using longitudinal random intercept models, my research treats gentrification as a dynamic process and examines this association using ACS 5-year estimates from 2011 to 2019 and crime data at the census tract level in Buffalo, NY. The results show a curvilinear relationship between gentrification and crime â€” in the years leading up to a tract being gentrified, there is, on average, an increase in crime that continues until a short period following this designation, and then, the crime rate begins to decrease.'
